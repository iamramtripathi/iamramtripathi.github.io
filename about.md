### About This Page

Hello! My name is Ram and I'm a fundamentally inquisitive person. From time to time, I embark on different endeavors - intellectual, creative and sometimes physical. I learn a lot of thins along the way and some of them I find are worth sharing. Hence this page.

### About Me

I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at [Rakuten][rakuten]. I work with all things data - data pipelines, stream processing, storage and good old sql query optimization. I dabble in functional programming and use `clojure` as my main programming language. Needless to say that I take immense interest in distributed, parallel and concurrent computing.

In my previous life I've worked at [Aruba Networks][aruba], [Juniper Networks][juniper] & [Google Summer of Code][gsoc] and got my Masters in Computer Science at [Rutgers University][rutgers].

Some of the other things that I'm passionate about:

- Singing (decibels no bar)
- Playing instruments (guitar & piano)
- Running marathons (forest gump style)
- Soccer (glory glory man united)
- Body building (who doesn't want them gains?)
- Nutrition (watch them calories)
