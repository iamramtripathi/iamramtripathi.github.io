### about this page

Hello! My name is Ram and I'm a fundamentally inquisitive person. This `inquisitiveness` of mine makes me take on many different endeavors (intellectual, creative, physical) and I would love to share some of my experiences with you all.

### about me

I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at [Rakuten][rakuten]. I work with all things data - data pipelines, stream processing, storage or good old sql query optimization. I dabble in functional programming and use `clojure` as my main programming language. Needless to say that I take immense interest in distributed, parallel and concurrent computing.

In my previous life I've worked at [Aruba][aruba], [Juniper Networks][juniper] & [Google Summer of Code][gsoc] and got my Masters is Computer Science at [Rutgers][rutgers].

Some of the other things that I'm passionate about

- Singing (decibels no bar)
- Playing instruments (guitar & piano)
- Running marathons (forest gump style)
- Soccer (glory glory man united)
- Body building (who doesn't want them gains?)
- Nutrition (watch them calories)
